c     For COSMO we need to know if cosmo is on and which phase we are in:
c
c     cosmo_on = logical telling us that COSMO should be used
c     cosmo_last = logical telling properties that last calculation was cosmo
c                  and that point charges need to be included in calculation
c     cosmo_phase = phase of calculation, 1=gas-phase, 2=sol-phase
c
      logical cosmo_on, cosmo_last
      integer cosmo_phase
c
      common /cosmo/
c
c     Logicals
c
     $     cosmo_on, cosmo_last,
c
c     Integers
c
     $     cosmo_phase
